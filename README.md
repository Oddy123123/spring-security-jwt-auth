# spring-security-jwt-auth

An example of Spring Security authentication and authorization with JWT using different data stores for different user types
- Employee (User): Authenticated using email and password
- Admin: Authenticated using username and password

This project includes a MySQL script `db_example.sql` to create the database tables

Note: the entity "User" should be renamed to "Employee" but I'm too lazy to do it now.
